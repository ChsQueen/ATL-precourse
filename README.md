## BARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
Bare minimum requirements are absolutely required. 

* Using [start.spring.io] create application/RESTful api (if this is foreign to you, a tutorial like this one walks through creating an application and will be helpful)
* Create at least one entity
* Write out full CRUD functionality (required): GET, GET ALL, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Test your application in Postman, submit screenshots of successful tests for each of these methods (via Slack is fine)
* If you don’t have Postman already installed, please do so, and get comfortable with its functionality. This is a great tool for manually testing your work while you’re learning.
* Push your project to GitHub, send us a link (via Slack is fine)
* Complete this Docker tutorial: [https://github.com/dylanlrrb/Please-Contain-Yourself]


## ADVANCED
Our advanced content is intended to throw you in over your head, requiring you to solve problems with very little support or oversight.

* Dockerize the application you wrote
* Push that Docker image to a Docker Hub public repository, send link (via Slack is fine)


## NIGHTMARE MODE
Nightmare mode is exactly what it sounds like: difficult. 

* Deploy your Dockerized application to an AWS EC2 instance
* Send screenshot proof of success (via Slack is fine)
* BEWARE of AWS charges - be sure to spin down when you’re done. We will not reimburse you for charges incurred (but Amazon probably will if you accidentally do this incorrectly).
